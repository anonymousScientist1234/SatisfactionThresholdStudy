# SatisfactionThresholdStudy

## Code Description

All simulation data is generated in the Matlab script masterScript.m. This code uses the functions chooseParameters.m, makeMeasurements.m, and runSims to generate this data. masterScript.m will generate the data file thresholdComparisons.csv. The thresholdComparisons.csv file currently in this folder is the one used by the manuscript. The script sensitivityAnalysis.m performs the sensitivity analysis described in supplementary material, and inputs the thresholdComparisons.csv file. The R file analyzeVisualizeData.R also inputs this file to do most of the statistics and figurs of the paper. The only figures not generated by the R script is the matlab script figs7andS2.m, which as the name implies, creates figures 7 and S2. 

To run these scripts, just ensure that all of these files are in the same directly. The one line of code that will need to be changed for your personal use is the setwd() command in the R script.
